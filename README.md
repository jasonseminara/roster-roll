# Roster-Roll
Roster management app

#### Project Title
Roster-Roll Lite edition. Version 1.0

#### Motivation: 
The motivation to build this application comes from personally managing a few sports teams over the past few years. I wanted to build a tool that would allow me to keep track of players, games, and attendance for games.

#### Build status:
The application is still in the development stage and not fully functioning. CRUD functionality works for the players table, however there is a bug when deleting a player. The action is completed, but the redirect is not working at the moment. Edit/Delete functionality works via button. Application is navigated by using the URL 

The application contains code for future features. This includes a games table as well as attendance. Only read of (CRUD) functionality for games. Can be accessed through /games.  

#### Code Style:
JavaScript follows AirBnB style guide.

#### Installation:
Functioning pages: /players
